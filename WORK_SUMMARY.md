### 4. GitHub Issue Templates (7 files in .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/)
**Purpose:** Standardize issue creation and reduce friction

**Templates created:**
1. **dataset-loader.md** - For implementing dataset loaders
2. **dl-model-enhancement.md** - For deep learning model work
3. **feature-enhancement.md** - For general feature additions
4. **bug-report.md** - For bug reports
5. **test-coverage.md** - For test improvement issues
6. **documentation.md** - For documentation improvements
7. **config.yml** - Configuration for issue templates

**Each template includes:**
- Structured sections for all necessary information
- Checklists for tasks
- Code examples and patterns
- Testing and documentation requirements
- Definition of done

### 5. Updated README.md
**Changes:**
- Enhanced "Contributing" section
- Added links to all new contributor resources
- Added emojis for better visual organization
- Added direct link to "good first issue" label
- Improved call-to-action for contributors

## Key Findings

### Repository Strengths
✅ Well-structured architecture  
✅ 86% test coverage (122 tests, 105 passing)  
✅ Good code quality tools (pre-commit hooks)  
✅ 4 fully implemented dataset loaders  
✅ Comprehensive testing framework documentation  

### Improvement Opportunities
⚠️ 2 dataset loaders incomplete (MobiFall, Arduous)  
⚠️ 5 deep learning models need validation/testing  
⚠️ 17 failing tests (14%)  
⚠️ Missing docstrings and type hints in some areas  
⚠️ TODOs in code need addressing  
⚠️ No Jupyter notebook tutorials  
⚠️ Limited CI/CD (single platform, single Python version)

## Next Steps for Repository Maintainers

### Immediate (Today)
1. ✅ Review and approve this PR
2. Create actual GitHub issues from ISSUES_FOR_CONTRIBUTORS.md
3. Label issues appropriately (good first issue, enhancement, etc.)
4. Pin or feature ISSUES_FOR_CONTRIBUTORS.md in repository

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Create 5-10 issues for "good first issue" candidates
2. Promote contributor opportunities on social media
3. Fix high-priority failing tests
4. Consider adding CONTRIBUTING.md link to PR template

### Medium-term (This Month)
1. Create remaining issues from the document
2. Set up project board to track progress
3. Begin work on high-priority items
4. Engage with first contributors

## Usage Examples

### For a Contributor Looking to Help

1. **Read QUICKSTART_CONTRIBUTORS.md** - Get set up (10 minutes)
2. **Browse ISSUES_FOR_CONTRIBUTORS.md** - Find an issue (5 minutes)
