3. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Missing examples for MobiFall and Arduous
   - Incomplete docstrings in some modules
   - No Jupyter notebook tutorials
   - Limited type hints coverage

4. **Technical Debt**
   - TODOs in code (visualization.py, main.py)
   - Need refactoring of sliding window implementation
   - Need to add noise filters
   - Deep learning models marked as TODO in __init__.py

5. **Infrastructure Improvements Needed**
   - Single platform testing (Linux only)
   - No multi-Python version testing
   - No automated release workflow
   - Missing Codecov badge in README
