## Implementation Guidelines

### Testing Structure
```python
class Test[ModelName]Model:
    def test_model_initialization(self):
        # Test model can be instantiated
        pass
    
    def test_model_training(self):
        # Test model training with sample data
        pass
    
    def test_model_prediction(self):
        # Test model prediction
        pass
    
    def test_model_evaluation(self):
        # Test model evaluation metrics
        pass
    
    def test_model_save_load(self):
        # Test model persistence
        pass
    
    def test_gpu_cpu_compatibility(self):
        # Test device handling
        pass
```

### Example Script Structure
```python
"""
Example: Training [Model Name] on [Dataset]

This example demonstrates:
1. Loading gait data
2. Preprocessing and feature extraction
3. Training [Model Name]
4. Evaluating model performance
5. Saving and loading the model
"""

import gaitsetpy as gsp

# Load data
loader = gsp.[DatasetLoader]()
data, names = loader.load_data("data/[dataset]")

# Preprocess
windows = loader.create_sliding_windows(data, names, window_size=..., step_size=...)

# Extract features (if needed)
extractor = gsp.GaitFeatureExtractor()
features = extractor.extract_features(windows[0]['windows'], fs=...)

# Train model
model = gsp.[ModelName]Model(...)
model.train(features)

# Evaluate
metrics = model.evaluate(features)
print(f"Accuracy: {metrics['accuracy']}")

# Save model
model.save_model("models/[model_name].pt")
```

## Model-Specific Considerations

### LSTM / BiLSTM
- Input shape: (batch_size, sequence_length, features)
- Consider sequence padding
- Document hidden state handling

### CNN
- Input shape for 1D CNN: (batch_size, channels, sequence_length)
- Document kernel sizes and their effects
- Consider pooling strategies

### MLP
- Input shape: (batch_size, features)
- Document layer architecture
- Consider dropout and regularization

### GNN
- Requires PyTorch Geometric
- Document graph construction from sensor data
- Document node and edge features
- Input shape: Graph objects with node/edge features

## Testing Requirements

- All tests must pass: `python run_tests.py`
- Code coverage for model code should be >80%
- Integration test should demonstrate end-to-end workflow
- GPU tests should be marked with `@pytest.mark.requires_gpu`

## Documentation Requirements

- Google-style docstrings for all public methods
- Type hints for all function parameters and returns
- Usage examples in docstrings
- Complete example script that runs without errors

## Performance Benchmarks

Expected performance on reference dataset (if applicable):
- Training time: [e.g., "< 5 minutes on CPU for Daphnet"]
- Inference time: [e.g., "< 1ms per sample"]
- Memory usage: [e.g., "< 500MB"]
- Accuracy: [e.g., "> 85% on Daphnet validation set"]
